Fuzzy Logic 


# Things I did
## Modified the ff:
1. Angle to Meter
2. Change the data for the Meter
3. Added a new rule I believe

# Has these following Set of Rules:
1. IF (`SPEED` IS `HIGH`) AND (`METER` IS `FAR`) THEN `THROTTLE` IS `LM`
2. IF (`SPEED` IS `HIGH`) AND (`METER` IS `AVG`) THEN `THROTTLE` IS `LM`
3. IF (`SPEED` IS `HIGH`) AND (`METER` IS `NEAR`) THEN `THROTTLE` IS `LOW`
4. IF (`SPEED` IS `OK`) AND (`METER` IS `FAR`) THEN `THROTTLE` IS `HM`
5. IF (`SPEED` IS `OK`) AND (`METER` IS `AVG`) THEN `THROTTLE` IS `MED`
6. IF (`SPEED` IS `OK`) AND (`METER` IS `NEAR`) THEN `THROTTLE` IS `LM`
7. IF (`SPEED` IS `LOW`) AND (`METER` IS `FAR`) THEN `THROTTLE` IS `HIGH`
8. IF (`SPEED` IS `OK`) AND (`METER` IS `AVG`) THEN `THROTTLE` IS `HM`
9. IF (`SPEED`IS `OK`) AND (`METER` IS `NEAR`) THEN `THROTTLE` IS `HM`
